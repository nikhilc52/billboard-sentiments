      <h2>1. Sentiment of the Billboard Top 100</h2>
      <div class="visualization" id="visualization1">
        <img id="sentiment-png" src="sentiment_graph.png" alt="Sentiment Graph">
      </div>
      <p>The above graph depicts a 5-year rolling average of the percentage of positive and negative songs within the
        end-of-year Billboard Top 100. It should be noted that certain songs were excluded from the data since they
        could not be matched to lyrics and thus could not be scored, which explains why some years might not have a
        percentage of positive and negative songs that add up to 100.</p>

      <p>While there are certainly fluctuations in sentiment over time, there is a general trend of negativity being
        more
        commonly found in top songs, with a visible shift being apparent at the turn of the century. This trend of
        negativity
        has continued into the songs themselves, that is, just as the makeup of Billboard songs have become more
        negative,
        the songs that are classified as negative (with a negative sentiment score) have been more extreme. For
        instance, in 1960,
        the average negative song had a score of -0.77, a much less negative sentiment than the 2015 -0.92.</p>

      <p>There are a number of reasons for such a drastic increase in negativity, one of which being the introduction of
        rap
        into mainstream culture. Since 2000, there has been an average of more than 12 songs classified as “rap” by
        Spotify,
        a stark increase from the mere three Top-100 placements the genre averaged before the 21st century. The
        correlation
        between the two trends is certainly interesting, but that is not to say that rap is inherently negative.
        Instead, looking
        at certain examples can help to paint a more clear picture of how rap has influenced total Billboard sentiment.
      </p>

      <p>In the 335 rap songs featured in our dataset, two songs stick out for their sentiment scores in relation to
        their
        personally-derived messaging. These songs are “Lifestyle” by Rich Gang and “Forever” by Drake. Charting in 2014
        and 2009,
        with sentiment scores of -0.9114 and -0.9992, respectively. From reading the scores, we would expect the songs
        to be undoubtedly
        negative, but having listened to them, they are certainly not as cynical as one would expect.</p>

      <p><em>Lifestyle</em> features multiple artists rapping about how they overcame certain struggles in their past
        lives,
        ultimately
        earning themselves a luxurious lifestyle:</p>

      <div class="lyrics">
        <p><em>"I done (Hey), did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle (Oh, yeah, woo)<br>
            We came straight from the bottom to the top, my lifestyle (Lifestyle, ayy)"</em></p>
      </div>

      <p>“Forever” is a similar record, featuring artists like Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Eminem orating their desire
        for eternal
        success as their had previously had nothing:</p>

      <div class="lyrics">
        <p><em>"But understand, nothin' was done for me<br>
            So I don't plan on stoppin' at all<br>
            I want this shit forever, mane"</em></p>
      </div>

      <p>Despite the seemingly obvious positive messages these songs depict, their scores indicate the exact opposite.
        One reason for
        this inaccuracy might be due to NLTK’s treatment of expletives. For experiment’s sake (as purposefully removing
        data is unethical),
        removing expletives from each of the songs, and feeding them back into NLTK’s library yields much more
        understandable scores of 0.9973
        for “Lifestyle” and 0.9737 for “Forever”, indicating that there is a strong negative weightage that NLTK places
        on these types of words.</p>

      <p>Whether or not this is a fair judgment is a personal question that depends on one’s own emotions towards strong
        language and
        whether or not they believe profanity can taint a positive message. For NLTK, it believes that profanity is
        always negative, and
        this understanding can help to clear up the scores for rap songs and the corresponding increase in negativity:
        rap is not inherently
        negative, but the positive messages it communicates are often accompanied by expletives, typically at a higher
        rate than other genres.
        This means that NLTK views rap as more negative than other types of music (not for its message, but for its
        delivery), and thus when rap
        is featured in the Billboard charts more frequently, the overall Billboard sentiment decreases - once again, not
        inherently because of
        its genre, but because of NLTK’s “personal” opinion on word choice.</p>

      <h2>2. Top Words of Billboard Songs</h2>
      <div class="visualization" id="visualization2">
        <img id="top_words-gif" src="top_words.gif" alt="Data Visualization 2">
      </div>
      <p> Above is a word cloud that shows a 5-year rolling average of the top words of Billboard Top-100 songs for a
        given year. The most common word in top songs was “love” until 1998, where it switched to “na” before being
        dominated by “like” and
        “yeah”, a trend that continues into 2024.</p>

      <p>The aforementioned idea of the rise of rap music coinciding with more frequent uses of expletives is confirmed
        by
        this chart, as near
        the end of the 2010s, we see a few instances of profanity being used at high rates in top songs, once again
        mirroring the timeline of
        the growth of rap.</p>

      <p>An interesting development within this data is the short period of time where “na” was the top word. While it
        has
        almost always been included in the top 100 songs, dating back to 1963, its dominance in the late 1990s can be
        traced back to a
        singular song, “Here Comes the Hotstepper”, which features the word “na” 79 times, predominantly featured in its
        well-known chorus. Released
        in 1994, this song would chart twice on the year-end Billboard Top 100, once in 1994 and once in 1995. The
        song’s
        use of “na” at such
        a high frequency coupled with its above-average longevity on the Top 100 made it have a substantial impact on
        our
        data, so much so
        that it changed the most used word for 4 consecutive years (since rolling averages were used). More than just a
        cool data-driven
        story, “Here Comes the Hotstepper” shows just how much one song can influence culture, as even after the song
        dropped out of the charts,
        its success likely contributed to other artists mimicking the song’s style, which is evident in the continued
        frequency of the word
        into the early 2000s.</p>
