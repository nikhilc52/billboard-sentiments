    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Music is a defining characteristic of culture...</p>
    <p>In this project we look to see if there are any key characteristics of songs within the Billboard Year-End Hot
      100, analyzing both their sentiment through NLTK's machine learning software and their features through the
      Spotify API. </p>
    <p>The sections above show how to navigate this website.<br><br>Within the "Essay" section, you will find a
      long-form
      article analyzing the effectiveness of using NLTK to "rate" songs, especially within the rap genre.<br><br>The
      "Dashboard" section holds an overview of the various plots made for this project, and through this page you can
      navigate to short writeups about each of the plots.<br><br>In the "About" section, you can view the sources used
      to get, clean, and plot the data, as well the people behind the project.</p>
