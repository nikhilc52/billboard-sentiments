        <p>The above graph shows that rap is an extreme outlier in terms of the number of expletives used in each song.
            With nearly eight uses of profanity (which are uses of the word “b***h, “s**t”, “n***a”, and “f**k”) per
            song, rap towers above the next closest genre, R&B, which has less than one expletive per song.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visualizing this information in a different way can help to explain this phenomenon more clearly. Below is a
            box plot representation of the same data:
        </p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../visuals/bar_graph_explicit/expletives_genre.png" width="30%">
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="text-container">
        <p>In this plot, one can see that the mean number of expletives in the rap genre is affected by a right skew,
            pulling the mean
            higher.
            Additionally, a number of extreme outliers, like Tyga's "<a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE3yia1AJeQ" target="_blank">Rack City</a>", which contains 71
            expletives (the most in the
            dataset), pull the mean up as well. So, while the average is high compared to other genres, there are still
            plenty of rap songs that are clean, just
            as there are plenty of songs from other genres that contain explicit language, even if the majority of other
            genre's songs
            are clean (making their box plots are barely visible).
        </p>
        <p>
            To combat this visibility problem, one can remove all the clean songs from the dataset. This is not the best
            practice since throwing away data is always an issue, but it can still convey valuable information: of the
            songs that do use profanity, how much profanity are they using?
        </p>

    <div class="image-container">

    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="text-container">
        <p>Now, the plot is much more visible, and the insight is relatively the same. Rap still uses the most
            profanity, but of the songs that are explicit, the difference in explicitness across genres is relatively
            small (as compared to the previous chart).
