        <p>This graph displays the average word complexity of the top 100 billboard songs over the years from 1960 to
            2019. The average word complexity was calculated through a combined score based on analysis of the lyrics.
            More specifically it is a combination of the diversity of words, the average word length, and the
            readability (calculated using the Flesch score through the textstat library).<br><br>As shown in the graph,
            the
            word complexity variability decreases over the years, with a large drop in the 1960's. This large drop in
            the 1960's may be attributed to cultural shifts; for instance, rock and roll as well as disco became more
            popular during this time, causing a change in emphasis on lyrical complexity to beat and rhythm. Similar to
            reasoning for the similarity of word complexity among genres, the relative stability post-1970 may be
            attributed to a shared song lyric structure for popular songs.
