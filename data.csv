2023,1,"""Last Night""",Morgan Wallen,"Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet


No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me


I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)


No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)


I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)"
2023,2,"""Flowers""",Miley Cyrus,"We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn


Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I


I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can


Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

2023,3,"""Kill Bill""",SZA,"I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'


I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should


I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone


I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will

2023,4,"""Anti-Hero""",Taylor Swift,"I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room


I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)


It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)


It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""


It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

2023,8,"""Fast Car""",Luke Combs,"You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove


You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'


See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way


So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone


You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs


So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving


So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone




You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision

There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

Compa, ¿qué le parece esa morra?
La que anda bailando sola me gusta pa' mí
¡Bella! Ella sabe que está buena
Que todos andan mirándola cómo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentación
Le dije: ""Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos días vas a ser mía""
Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta
Que ningún vato como yo actúa


Y ahí te va, mija
Y pura Doble P, viejo

Threw so many racks, a bitch can't even see the floor
From Atlanta to L.A., the only time I'm back and forth
Cheap niggas make you pick, rich niggas get you both
Gave the Bentley to valet and let that nigga drive the boat
Shh, be quiet (Be quiet), lеt me pop off
Leave thе club sloppy drunk, come home and get my rocks off
Heard ""Bitch from Da Souf,"" he tryna see me knock his socks off
Told them bitches, ""Meet me at the top,"" think they got lost
Tuh, I'm on go like Grizz

Swear that nigga set for life, I let him get me preg'

Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets
We gave each other more than our hearts
With the help of a mason jar


Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was minе
Too young to know what love was
But we werе learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine


I don't remember where we got it from
I just remember feelin' all grown up
Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing
Never told him it was my first drink
But I told him that he was the one
You're so sure when you're that young
You think you got it all figured out
And now I laugh when I think about
Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine


I thought that high would last forever
But that ain't what it does
Maybe we were drunk in love
Or maybe we were just


Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was

A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke
The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count


'Cause I just wanna see
If this could make me happy


Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?


A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't

Йеа, жизнь
Жизнь — единственное, в чём мы нуждаемся
Им же нужно избавиться от меня, но я не хочу уходить
Покойся с миром, Лил Кид


Нахуй голубятню, я — сова, совершенно другой уровень
Мог бы заставить её набить шестёрку на мизинце
Слышал, ты фанатеешь по баскетболу, просто дай мне знать
Будешь сидеть на играх в первом ряду, а не в далеке
Всё впоряде, детка, по крайней мере, сейчас
Не хочу стрессовать из-за суки, ведь скромности у меня не отнять
Ещё я готовлю амбиции прямо на кухонной плите
Травка уже кипит, смотри на пенку, хорошо пойдёт
Шлюхи говорят я обходителен, поэтому не попаду в лапы RICO
Бро считает себя Джоном Уэйном, купил ему жёлтых камней
Мне нравятся их тусовочки, детка, на хуй силикон
Все люди сейчас фейковые, ты могла бы разгадать мой шифр
Всё покрою брюликами и розовым золотом
Говорю с вами на языке дредов, словно Джей Коул
Могу сказать её минет хорош перед тем, как это узнать
Сучка, не строй из себя модель, если не была на обложке Vogue
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Они не пишут рэп, но могли бы выдать пару строк
Покойся с миром, Драма Кинг, мы с тобой умели показать стиль
Не нравится, как я говорю? Ниггер, скажи сам чё-то
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Подьезжаем и ты узнаешь нас, басс бомбит нехило

Если хочешь вести здесь свои дела, то придётся брать ствол (21, 21)
А то бегаешь вокруг в страхе, подбери своё дерьмо (21)
Влюбился так, что голова идёт кругом, вот как я кручусь на районе (21)
Безумно люблю своего Boy'я, мой брат-близнец (21)
Если ниггеры продолжат диссить, то налетим опять на них (21)
Мы — причина, почему у оппов нет друзей (21)
Последний, кто хотел поиграть со мной, стал призраком
Я не зароллил его в Woods, ведь он заплесневел уже
Ты спрашиваешь, как её дела, я только что сказал прийти ей и заняться сексом
Выстрелил в него двадцать раз, блять, ниггер везунчик (Блять, ниггер везунчик)

I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco

Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up

I met her down at Aldean's
تو رستوان بار ""اَلدنز نشویل"" دیدمش
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
گفت که حدود یک مایل دورتر من رو در حال قدم زدن دید
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
پسر خاله ام ""بین"" فقط میخواست تلفنش رو ازش بگیره (تا ازم فیلم نگیره) و همین لبخندش رو از بین بر
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
گفت زیادی مست و دیوونه ام، نحوه رقصیدنم رو دوست نداره
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
گفتم: مجبور نیستی بهم ملحق بشی. گفت شانسشو امتحان میکنه

We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?


Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back


I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad

Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend


Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case

Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel


Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here


Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove


Some things just go better together and probably always will

Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name


Would just sound better together and probably always will

This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain


Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved


I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape


Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then he calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss


I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know he's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope he comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope he spends his last dime to put a rock on your hand
I hope he's wilder than your wildest dreams
He's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me


I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy (Oh woah, oh)
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans (Oh)
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me


Like you did on me"
2020,13,"""Whats Poppin""","Jack Harlow featuring DaBaby, Tory Lanez and Lil Wayne","Tornato con il remix
Questi ragazzi tutti miei figli come Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
La mia città e il mio stato non hanno mai visto questo
Jimmy Neutron, sono un ragazzo prodigio (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Sul futon, le sto dando quel cazzo
Quando questa merda è pronta, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, come Gilbert Arenas, sparo il colpo
Sono ancora con i demoni, ooh, I keep it thorough
Ho cinque tipe a New York
Questo significa una in ogni quartiere
Sono nel pocket come Burrow
Quando sono tornato a casa, though
Mi trattano come Robert De Niro
La ho portata Taco Bell, le ho comprato un churro
La ho portata a casa, le ho dato un cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year old
Zeri su zeri su zeri (Zeri)
Quello è cosa il bilancio del mio conto bancario dice (Woo)
Ho a check dalla compagnia di scarpe
Ora faccio qualsiasi cosa che dice New Balance
Le ho comprato un biglietto aereo, fuori di stato
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Ho detto, ""Sono in città oggi""
Lei ha detto che she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' quella merda
Così quando she pull up on me so cosa she 'bout to say
You might also like
Come butta?
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
Ho delle opzioni
Potrei passare quella puttana come Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin' (Oh, these niggas got me fucked up, nigga)

Il mio corpo got rid of them toxins (Let me go, mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top dieci


Chiama la mia puttana, dille, ""Prendimi that noggin"" (Brrt)
Brain real good, she a scholar
I like the thing with low mileage, good brain with no college
Chiamami DaBaby, no toddler (Wah)
Sono un vero creativo and stylish, F&N nel mio denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back da L.A. sul jet ieri (Nyoom)
I go back and forth come se giocassi a tennis
Fotto con la tua puttana, yeah, I'm fit for it
Ancora su Billboard, la canzone numero uno nel Regno Unito
And I done got so fuckin' rich, tutte queste puttane sul mio cazzo
Non mi frega ancora un cazzo di cosa mi dicono
Lei lo mangia come Pac-Man, negro (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga come se fossi Batman, negro (Eat it)
I just pulled up nella Batmobile (Nyoom)
La ragione per cui non fotto con questi rap-ass negri
Perché loro sono cap-ass negri (Cap)
E il loro rap non è vero (Cap)
Credimi, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, bisogno di un Squeegee
These niggas watered down, loro bevono Fiji
La mia auto è arancione e marrone come se fossi a Cleveland
La mia puttana è Mello Yello come una soda (Soda)
Questi negri tattletalers, io sono un soldato
Ayy, qualcuno dica a questi negri che è finita
Tu sai è Baby, negro

Come butta? (Poppin')
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Woo, hahaha)
Ho delle opzioni (Ayy)
Potrei passare quella puttana come Stockton (Uh)


Hop out that Scat and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody daughter
Lei mi chiama papi, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler in case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch
That I don't ever got to stunt again, nigga, lil' Tory

Come butta? (Canada)

2020,18,"""Everything I Wanted""",Billie Eilish,"I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)


I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me


And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
You might also like
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down


I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me


And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""


If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"

2020,21,"""Before You Go""",Lewis Capaldi,"I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say


When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't


So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go


Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
You might also like
When you hurt under the surface

Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go


Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know


Before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us

Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP

Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense


And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart


Ooh
Ooh


And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
Just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
And the bluebird sings
Ooh"
2020,92,"""Wishing Well""",Juice Wrld,"Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, uh
I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well


I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel


Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished
You might also like
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me


I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel


Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me


I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well

2020,93,"""Does to Me""",Luke Combs featuring Eric Church,"I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me


So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me


I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me


There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me


So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to meEmbed"

2020,96,"""More Than My Hometown""",Morgan Wallen,"Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know


That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown


I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown


Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em


'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more"

I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots


But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you


I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick


I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise

When I die, put my money in the grave


When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave


Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)

Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'

These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me

Wondering if it was worth it or not

I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan

And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face


And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""


So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away

I checked out a long time ago
Texting, you missed it
Touch it, had enough that
She got you sprung
So I pulled up, they start a case of charity
After you begging me, begging for company
Never needed you, you only needed me
All that talk just to settle being weak
Had too much tequila, so save that shit for the next one
It goes in one ear, and out the next one
Said you put me out, why you lying?
I left on my own, had you crying
I was tryna keep your bidness silent
Tried to keep the peace instead of being violent
Thought we squashed the bygones and remained friends?
Truth be told, you're the one that's high maintenance
Let's be real, I threw you out
¿El a-El anillo pa' cuándo?
But your time ran out
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Y me fui en la mía por ahí (Eh), no me haces falta

Y la vida me ha enseñado que donde hubo fuego cenizas quedan (Bebé)
Yo te boté de mi corazón y ya ahí de ti nada queda, te boté
Eres de las que espera que la nota le suba
Le pedí al DJ que le ponga la de Guatauba
Que no le baje después que la suba
Que ella quiere olvidarme y al eco le pidió ayuda
Botella' de Rosé, eh, han baja'o como doce
Ella dice que la boté y, pero te la dejé
To'as sus foto' las borré y por todas las rede' la bloqueé

All der andere Scheiß, über den ich rede, sie denken sie wissen es
Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft
Und mein  Leben bedeutet nichts
Ich weiß es, ich weiß es, ich weiß, dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin, aber kann es nicht zeigen

Ich hatte nie ein Zuhause

Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can


The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets


Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can


We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up


Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""


I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old


Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow


I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

2017,41,"""Bad Things""",Machine Gun Kelly and Camila Cabello,"
CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. She’s running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the city’s center.

As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer — who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says, “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.

Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.

Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).

But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.

She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.

“It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,” says her friend Mendes, adding, “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.”

But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.

“You know that quote, ‘In the silence, you find God?’ ” asks Cabello, who — in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.”

The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.)

Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé.

The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.
Zayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler.

Niall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the ’70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier.

Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.

Cabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply.

But that hasn’t stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing “Bad Things” to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmony’s final televised performance).

She has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I’m going to stick up for immigrants, and I’m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.”

After Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, “the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.”

“The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?” says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone.

“I mean,  at the peak of our career. It’s definitely not the safe option.” But, she says, “I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don’t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.” She flings her arms like she’s on a roller coaster. “I feel alive!”

The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony’s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5H’s career, despite the grueling schedule.

Her friend Taylor Swift’s Red inspired her to make “sonic photographs” of her changing life, so when she wasn’t cutting parts for 5H’s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood’s Record Plant, she would be in the studio’s gym, writing lyrics over other artists’ melodies about things like “my first kiss and my first boyfriend.” Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out “shitty demos” while touring malls and, in time, arenas.

“I would wake up super early,” says Cabello, “get off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud — I didn’t want people to hear me f—ing yelling — then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.”

So she was basically singing into the toilet?
“Yep.”

“She has done her 10,000 hours,” says Cabello’s manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. “Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.”

But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.

When I ask her about it, Cabello doesn’t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road:

*When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*

I don’t know. I was always super open  I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.

*Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?*

I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it’s because of this thing or  thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat.

*Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*

No.

*Have you reached out directly?*
I did, yeah. I don’t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.

*When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, “I’m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn’t a surprise.” Then I was like, “What’s happening?”*

I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.
Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Cancún.

“The first four days were trippy,” says Cabello. “I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you’re afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!”

Cabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as she’s called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.

Alejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company.

“My parents worked really hard,” says Cabello. “We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.”

(Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.)

Cabello’s Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for “Friendsgiving” in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.

She’s not much for going out: “I had a phase in Miami where I was like, ‘I’m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,’ ” which she is. “I went , and I was like, ‘I don’t love this.’ ”

After our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some “chill stuff.”

Mainly, Cabello’s focused on making music.

Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.

She also enjoys practicing guitar — 5H player and “super close friend” Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group’s 7/27 Tour in 2016.

Romantically speaking, says Cabello, “I don’t have anything going on right now,” although she does let slip that “literally every boy I’ve liked has been a Scorpio.” (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.)

And when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story:

“I love the movie because I’m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, ‘I just came out of a relationship.’ He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, ‘You know what? I’ll get his number.’ He never texted me back.” What? “I don’t know. Maybe it didn’t go through.”

A few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabello’s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called “It’s Only Natural” using her achiest coo and a slight patois: “It’s only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It’s only human to, wanna do da tings we do.” The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack Ü-style edited vocal samples.

“I never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision,” says Andrew “Pop” Wansel, who’s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room.

“It’s a real collaboration,” chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. “Sometimes it’s like a band just jamming.”

The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello’s love for Rihanna’s ANTI (“I can loop it forever,” she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys’ 2007 song “No One,” all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music.

They want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called “Havana” and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in “One Dance.”

“Camila is an incredible songwriter,” says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio “L.A.” Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. “She is working overtime.”

Cabello’s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn’t a momager so much as her daughter’s right hand and confidante.

Along with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabello’s side the entire time, and now she’s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello.

Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5H’s People’s Choice Awards performance of “Work From Home” in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the “I” to “We” in Cabello’s opening line, “I ain’t worried about nothing,” and punctuated it with a full stop.

“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ If I’m growing as an artist, that’s success.”

In April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group’s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn’t cry was Cabello.

“I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.’ I’m sorry about that,” she tells me this time around.

Cabello wasn’t immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then — that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.

“It’s so hard to hear that,” says Cabello, lowering her head. “It breaks my heart. It’s like I’m watching myself from another person’s perspective, like, ‘Damn, poor girl.’ ”

She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, “I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this  doesn’t have to be World War III. In Cuba, people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks, throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That’s real shit. Not this.

“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ ” continues Cabello. “To me, if I’m in the studio every day and I’m growing as an artist and I’m speaking from my heart, that’s success. The results don’t matter. I mean, isn’t that the goal?”

If Cabello is anxious now, it doesn’t show. She seems proud of what 5H was — “We represented all different kinds of women coming together,” she says fondly — but is candid about what it wasn’t:

“We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it.”Embed"

Julio y Tenoch emprendieron el regreso
Fue un viaje sin eventualidades y muy silencioso
Sus familias no se enteraron de que su viaje fue a la playa
Ni de la compańía de Luisa
Ella se quedó en San Bernabé para comenzar al día siguiente su exploración por las Bahías de la zona
Al despedirse de Tenoch y Julio, Luisa les dijo:
La vida es como la espuma por eso hay que darse como el mar


Stop playing with me
Not sure how to feel
And I'm too drunk to see
It’s my mind you always steal
What's even real, oh, what's even there
I’m not sure but I want more


I spend too much time on Tiktok yuh
Shake that ass or kick rocks
Rocks like Bedrock
Rocks like red rock
At the Grand Canyon
I would fuck Megan Thee Stallion
She said wet ass pussy, well, like a river
And I got your bitch buyin' me dinner
My stomach is full but I still pull
Pull on the stick while I pull your bitch
I hate being lonely
So I fuck on the homies
You can say I want the whole crew
But your mom, she's a hoe too
How do I know you ask?
Well last night I was tappin' that ass
Let's switch up the flow
Pour me some more

Too Biggie to be here stressin'
Lemme teach you a lesson
I'll kill you with these bars
They gon’ take your ass on a stretcher, nah
But on some real shit, I’m just tryna hit
Don't leave me celibate, I’ll hit you on your cell in a bit
I'm just tryna sell the next big hit
You hear that flush? Yeah it's me, I'm the shit

Tired and solemn that's why I kneel and pray

Flicking this zoot but I miss the damn ashtray
Gassin' me gassin' you these bars are on the airway
Happiest memories at other fuckers' birthdays
Don't know what I feel I treat like child's play
Don't like myself but I fly like I'm a blue jay
Wish you would call me by your name like Chalamet
This life don't matter and I ain't tryna downplay
These are just bars it's not a fuckin' essay
Everyday wishin' that I would fade away
Smoke that gas I'm packin' but I'm not from Green Bay
Dead inside but I still cheese and smile everyday
It's a good life this ain't no doomsday
Yet at least
We got some time to get our shit together
In the meantime I let my soul weather
Floating through life like I'm a feather


Never knew I would feel fine
But I always felt one day I'd shine
Gotta wait until the stars align

Ayo deadass dude my fucking nipples are hard now dawg shit

Making songs with the homies you know we don't play
But sometimes i feel down
Ridin' around town
Get to your place and it's better then my own
I only want you like a dog without a bone
But yesterday I didn't know
You are the only one to make me whole, yuh
Bouncin' on my flow
You know how it go
Got all the girls looking at my toes
Even tho they look like ass
But they still ride the boat
When I smoke that gas
I feel like i'm afloat
On some clouds with my girl
Wearin' her sweatshirt like i'm earl
You can't fuck with my drip
Like a faucet failing
All I wanna do is kiss your lips
Navigate your body like I'm sailing
We don't do any work in this room
We're like Lebron sweepin' with a broom
This is slight work yuh
Hall of fame like I'm Dirk

I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand


But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?

2016,7,"""Hello""",Adele,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if, after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet


There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Anymore

Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)

2016,12,"""7 Years""",Lukas Graham,"Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old


It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure


Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old


I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me


Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old


Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old


I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry


Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage

Podríamos ser hermosos
Emborracharnos de la buena vida, te llevaré al paraíso

Still missing you and I can't

Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you


I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her


I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low

I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her


All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?


I hate you, I love you

I guess right now you've got the last laugh


I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So, tell my friends that I'll be over here


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more
